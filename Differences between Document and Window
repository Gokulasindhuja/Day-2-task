Differences between Document and Window Objects

Document Object: 
                The document object represent a web page that is loaded in the browser. By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page. With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.


Window Object:
              The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage. Whenever a window appears on the screen to display the contents of the document, the window object is created.

    window using the window document.              window only. i.e. window.window

 => The document is part of BOM (browser        => The window is part of BOM, not DOM
    object model) and dom (Document 
    object model)

    as title, body, cookies, etc can               be accessed by the document object
    also be accessed by a window like
    this window. document.title
